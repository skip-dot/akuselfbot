============================
This text is here to run you through a basic idea of what the setup does.
============================
To put it simply all it requires is your token, this lets the selfbot run
on your account. You can get your own token by following these steps.
============================
[1] Open the discord app
[2] Hold CTRL+SHIFT+I
[3] You should see 2 arrows on the top bar of the dev console [Looks something like >>]
[4] Then follow these steps - 
    Application > Local Storage > https://discord.com > Scroll down and press CTRL+R [Restarts Discord]
[5] Once your discord has loaded back up you can see a string it's completely randomized.
[6] Then to finalize you can paste it into the config.json file.

[KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS WILL NOT WORK ON WEB BROWSER.]
============================
Once you've got your token you can run the setup and it'll run 
you through the config setup.

There's 2 options to this setup, it's pretty simple and more will
get added onto this whenever there's an update to the actual config file.

[1] Default Option -
    As stated, everything in the setup will be set to its default settings.
[2] Custom Option -
    Again, as stated wthis option lets you customise everything to your
    preference.
============================
            [FAQ]
[1] What is a token?
    A token is a form of UID [Unique Identifier] for your discord account however
    it's private, with the token you can get account information such as email,
    password, billing details etc, but it also lets the selfbot log in to your
    account and give you abilities you wouldn't have without it.
[2] Can I get banned for using this?
    To keep it short and simple, yes, selfbots are bannable if you're reported
    by someone.
[3] How can I not get banned?
    Don't be stupid.
[4] Can I sell this?
    I mean, you do you but the source is out there and there's many other sources
    which are better than this one however this one is a bit more up to date than
    some of the older sources on github.
[5] Why did you make this?
    Boredom.
[6] Can I add my own commands to the selfbot?
    If you can code python, sure.
    [-] How can I add my own commands?
        You can copy and paste them from other selfbots, however you need to make
        sure that it's discord.py rewrite, and not an old version of discord.py
        otherwise it won't work.
[7] The selfbot isn't working for me?
    you'll have to wait for a new version to release or use an older version that
    worked for you.

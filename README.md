# Aku's Selfbot

A selfbot is a tool for discord that lets you access things you wouldn't usually have as a user.

# SETUP
- Run `setup.py`
- Let the program do its thing, it'll create a file called `requirements.txt` and install the necessary requirements.
- Once the requirements are installed, it'll create a new file called `SETUPNEW.py` which will run through creating the `config.json` file.

# Config File
The config file as of now only has 2 settings.
- Token - Your discord user token which lets the bot connect to your account.
- Prefix - What you want to use to activate commands - `>help`
So running the custom option that I decided to add in there for some reason, is practicall useless.

# IMPORTANT
Whatever happens to your account while using this tool is not my fault, this was made for educational purposes and however you use it is not my problem.

# Inspiration
- [Plex](https://github.com/PlexyBoi) - He's the only reason I decided to recode this stupid thing

# Questions
- If there are any questions just open an issue, and I'll answer it whenever I get time.

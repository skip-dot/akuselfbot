# Aku's Selfbot

A selfbot is a tool for discord that lets you access things you wouldn't usually have as a user.

# SETUP
- Run `setup.py`
- Let the program do its thing, it'll create a file called `requirements.txt` and install the necessary requirements.
- Once the requirements are installed, it'll create a new file called `SETUPNEW.py` which will run through creating the `config.json` file.

# Config File
The config file as of now only has 2 settings.
- Token - Your discord user token which lets the bot connect to your account.
- Prefix - What you want to use to activate commands - `>help`

- So running the custom option that I decided to add in there for some reason, is practicall useless.

# IMPORTANT
Whatever happens to your account while using this tool is not my fault, this was made for educational purposes and however you use it is not my problem.

and also there's no help command, i'll add one when I'm bothered enough. I'll also probably add cogs to this thing since it's a mess for myself

# Inspiration
- [Plex](https://github.com/PlexyBoi) - He's the only reason I decided to recode this stupid thing

# Questions
- If there are any questions just open an issue, and I'll answer it whenever I get time.

# Working On
- Cogs
- Error Handlers
